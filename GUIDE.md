## 🎖️ The Streak & Badge System

Consistency is key in development. DevArcade rewards you for daily practice.

### Dual Streak Tracking
1. **Global Streak**: Your overall daily consistency across any game.
2. **Game-Specific Streak**: Tracks your mastery in individual modules (e.g., *Syntax Sprint Streak*).

**Note:** The badge bar intelligently switches to show your **Game Streak** when you are playing a specific game, allowing you to track mastery in specific skills.

### 🏅 Rank Badges
Unlock badges by maintaining your streak. Each badge represents a milestone in your developer journey.

| Badge Rank | Day Streak | Color | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Hello World** | 1 Day | 🟢 Emerald | The journey begins. Unlocked on your first play. |
| **Script Kiddie** | 3 Days | 🟡 Yellow | You're getting the hang of it. |
| **Code Ninja** | 7 Days | 🟣 Violet | A week of consistent training. |
| **Full Stack** | 30 Days | 🔴 Rose | Monthly mastery. A true habit. |
| **Architect** | 60 Days | 🔵 Cyan | Elite consistency. The master builder. |
